# Picoharp
## Fast parsing code for PicoHarp TCSPC device by PicoQuant

ReadOutput_Picoharp reads and parses a PTU file generated by Picoharp TCSPC 
device (PicoQuant) and converts into a matlab structure called output. 

**Input:** PTU file (.out extension) <br/>
**Output:** Matlab structure called output that contains photon records and
special events (markers)

ReadOutput_Picoharp is based on similar functions that parses files generated
by Hydraharp TCSPC device by PicoQuant:
 1) Read_PTU.m written by PicoQuant (https://github.com/PicoQuant)
 2) Read_PTU_V1.m written by Omri Bar-Elli and Ron Tenne
    (https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/61789-read_ptu_v1-filepath)
    Read_PTU_V1.m parses bin files generated by Hydraharp
The second function is ~100x faster than the first. I added a new
feature, see parseOutData(output), which parses the data in a readable
way and also performs some sanity checks along the way.
3) ReadOutput_Hydraharp.m that is a similar script for Hydraharp devices 
   written by my colleague, Dr. Ji Hyun Nam
